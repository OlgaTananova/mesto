# Project: Mesto

Mesto is a pet-project created as part of a web-development course by Yandex.Practicum. Its primary objective is
to use JavaScript concepts in practice.

To build the project, a range of technologies were used:

1. CSS:
	- Flexbox and Gridlayout were used to create an adaptive page layout.
	- Relative block sizes and CSS functions were used to create flexible block sizes.
	- Media queries were used to optimize the page for various screen sizes.

2. HTML:
	- Various semantic tags were used to enhance the accessibility of the page for users.

3. JavaScript (ES6):
  - DOM structure was utilized to select and manipulate page elements;
  - CSS classes were manipulated to alter the style of the page;
  - Form text fields were processed and validated through JavaScript;
  - Arrays and HTML template tags were used to manipulate the content of the page;
  - Mouse and keyboard events were handled,
  - and site functionality was organized into classes (OOP).

4. Webpack(5):
  - Webpack was used to build the project, with two different modes (dev and build);
  - JavaScript code was combined, transpiled, and minified with Babel;
  - CSS files were consolidated and compressed into a single file;
  - Fonts and images were configured for processing.

5. The project is connected to a remote server:
    - REST API requests were used for client-server interaction.

7. The CSS file structure is based on BEM.
